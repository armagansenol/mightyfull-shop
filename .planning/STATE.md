# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** The shopping experience must work flawlessly with visual polish that matches the brand
**Current focus:** Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2 (SCSS Migration)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Dependency Upgrades) — COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in Phase 1 — all plans done
Status: Phase 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — Completed Plan 01-03: state/form/utility upgrades, Zod v4 migration, Biome replacing ESLint+Prettier

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~4.3 minutes
- Total execution time: ~13 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 3/3 | ~13 min | ~4.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (5 min)
- Trend: Fast — dependency upgrades completing quickly

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Plain CSS modules chosen over SCSS — reduces build complexity, leverages native CSS nesting and custom properties
- [Init]: Tailwind v4 upgrade sequenced after SCSS migration — PostCSS pipeline constraint, not preference
- [Init]: Visual parity is the non-negotiable success gate — zero automated tests means manual verification is a required phase
- [01-01]: pnpm already installed standalone (v10.24.0) — corepack enable skipped due to permission error, pnpm works correctly without it
- [01-01]: Added `onlyBuiltDependencies` for sharp/esbuild/@parcel/watcher to handle pnpm v10 build script security model
- [01-01]: No codemod changes needed — Next.js codemod confirmed project already at v16.1.6 target
- [01-01]: All async APIs already correct — no params or cookies() fixes needed
- [01-02]: Sanity v3->v5, next-sanity v9->v12, @portabletext/react v3->v6: zero API migration needed — all existing import patterns still valid
- [01-02]: ImageAsset from sanity v5 and PortableTextBlock/PortableTextComponents from @portabletext/react v6 work as type-only exports — no source changes required
- [01-02]: Upgraded in 4 logical groups with individual commits — each group is a working build state
- [01-03]: Zod v4 migration: z.string().email() replaced with z.email() — top-level method on both named and namespace imports
- [01-03]: @hookform/resolvers v5 supports both Zod v3 and v4 schemas via duck-typing — import path unchanged
- [01-03]: Biome v2 VCS integration handles .gitignore exclusions automatically — no manual ignore list needed
- [01-03]: 14 Biome recommended rules disabled for codebase patterns — fresh start defaults without breaking working code
- [01-03]: ESLint and Prettier fully removed; biome check/format replace lint/prettier scripts

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Audit `tailwindcss-animate` v4 compatibility before committing — likely incompatible, may need native CSS @keyframes replacement
- [Phase 3]: Confirm exact `tailwind-merge` version that supports Tailwind v4 class name format

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-27
