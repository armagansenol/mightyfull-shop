## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Plain CSS modules chosen over SCSS — reduces build complexity, leverages native CSS nesting and custom properties
- [Init]: Tailwind v4 upgrade sequenced after SCSS migration — PostCSS pipeline constraint, not preference
- [Init]: Visual parity is the non-negotiable success gate — zero automated tests means manual verification is a required phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Verify Hydrogen React + Next.js latest compatibility matrix before upgrading (medium confidence gap)
- [Phase 3]: Audit `tailwindcss-animate` v4 compatibility before committing — likely incompatible, may need native CSS @keyframes replacement
- [Phase 3]: Confirm exact `tailwind-merge` version that supports Tailwind v4 class name format
